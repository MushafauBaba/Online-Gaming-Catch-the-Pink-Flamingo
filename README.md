# Online-Gaming-Catch-the-Pink-Flamingo

## This project is to explore dataset from different datapoints from an online gaming platform. 

This project explores data and is used to complete the Data Analytics with Artificial Intelligence Individual formative assignment 1. The goal of the project is to design and implement a Big Data solution for the online game "Catch the Pink Flamingo."
The project's data comprises 9 files containing information on in-app purchases, ad clicks, and game-specific information, but for the sake of the assignment, I would be working on the ad-clicks, buy-clicks and users csv files only in the initial stage.

The project is framed into 5 major steps:
* ETL pipelines
* Data Visualisation with Matplotlib, plotly and seaborn
* Analysis
* Results and Insights discussion.

This project is aimed to answer the following questions;
* Exploring the Advert dataset to find out key questions on the team and user with the most ad targeted?
* Explore the in game purchase dataset, to find out team and user with the most in game purchase
* Categorise the spenders om the platform
* Understand the age demography of the players
* The country where the game is popular
* Analysis in-game purchase and optimization
  
## The algorithm to using this framework is as follows;
* Initial descriptive analysis
* EDA
* Data visualisation using Matplotlib, plotly and seaborn
* Feature engineering


## The project is still work in progress.
